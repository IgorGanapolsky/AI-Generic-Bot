   ```
   
   #### Running on a Physical Android Device
   - Enable Developer options and USB debugging on your device
   - Connect your device via USB and authorize the connection
   - Run `adb devices` to verify the device is detected
   - Then run `npx react-native run-android`

   ### For iOS

   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
   The APK will be available at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
   
   #### iOS Release Build
   Use Xcode to create an archive and distribute the app through App Store Connect or as an Ad Hoc distribution.

   - The Bot ID and Alias ID should auto-populate from `bot_info.json`
   - Or enter them manually from your AWS console

## Mobile App Troubleshooting

### Android Issues
- **Build fails with SDK errors**: Ensure Android SDK paths are correctly set in your environment
- **App crashes on startup**: Check that you have completed the React Native setup for Android development
- **Gradle timeout errors**: Add `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g` to `android/gradle.properties`

### iOS Issues
- **Pod install failing**: Try `pod repo update` before running `pod install`
- **Xcode build errors**: Ensure you have the latest Xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install`
- **Signing issues**: Configure your Apple Developer account in Xcode's Signing & Capabilities section

### General Issues
- **Metro bundler crashes**: Clear the cache with `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- **Red screen errors**: Check the error message and console logs for specific issues
- **Performance issues**: Enable Hermes engine in `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/Podfile`
